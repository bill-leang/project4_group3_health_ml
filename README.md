## Introduction:
Heart health is a very crucial subject that concerns us all. It's never too early or late to manage your risk of heart disease and improve your heart health. Furthermore, medical tests can be inaccessible to some and although it shouldn't replace professional medical advice, a model that can accurately predict heart attack risk based on inputted features can provide the user with a good starting point and urge users at risk to seek further medical advice to increase their heart health. 

## Project Brief
The objective of the study is to look at biological and circumstantial health indicators and analyse features such as age, BMI, family history and heart rate to build a model that can learn and classify the risk of heart attacks, based on user inputs. Subsequently, we aim to visualise the spread of heart attacks around the world. The research uses a dataset from Kaggle.
