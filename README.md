## Project Proposal 4, Group 3 - Heart Health Indicators

The objective of the study is to look at biological and circumstantial health indicators and analyse features such as age, BMI, family history and heart rate to build a model that can learn and classify the risk of heart attacks, based on user inputs. Subsequently, we aim to visualise the spread of heart attacks around the world. The research uses a dataset from Kaggle.
